  <key id="1226205419008418" feature="" locale="" npc="케이틀린" name="Patience! You can't break a seal like this just by waving a magic wand. Undoing a protection charm is extremely intricate work." />
  <key id="1226205419008419" feature="" locale="" npc="케이틀린" name="This charm isn't particularly difficult to undo so much as it is a chore. I'll need a number of reagents for my work, including several vials of the $itemPlural:30001033$." />

  <key id="1226205419008434" feature="" locale="" npc="케이틀린" name="Good. Now, as I've said, the protection charm on this book has two components. The first is the seal preventing the book from being opened." />
